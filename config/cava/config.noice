## Configuration file for CAVA. Default values are commented out.  Use either ; or # for commenting.


[general]

# smoothing mode, can be normal, scientific or waves.
mode = normal
 
# Framerate Default: 60. Accepts only non-negative values.
; framerate = 60 

# Sensitivity in  %. If you think the bars are to low/response is to little, try
# increasing this value 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.
; sensitivity = 100

# Autosens will attempt to decrease sensitivity if cava peaks. 1 = on, 0 = off
; autosens = 1

# The number of bars. 0 (default) sets it to auto (fill up console).
# width of bars and space between bars in number of characters. Default width 3 and space 1.
; bars = 0 
bar_width = 2
bar_spacing = 1


# Lower and higher cutoff frequencies for lowest and highest bars
# the bandwith of the visualizer, defaults to 50 - 10000 Hz
# Note: there is a minimum total bandwith of 43Mhz x number of bars. 
# Cava will automatically increase the higher cuttoff if a too low band is specified.
; lower_cutoff_freq = 50 
; higher_cutoff_freq = 10000 



[input]

# method of capturing audio, possible methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
# Defaults to 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source' 
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# for pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them)
# 
# for alsa 'source' will be the capture device. Default: 'hw:Loopback,1'
# for fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file. Default: '/tmp/mpd.fifo' 
; method = pulse
; source = auto

; method = alsa  
; source = hw:Loopback,1 

; method = fifo
; source = /tmp/mpd.fifo



[output]

# method used to draw output may be ncurses, noncurses.
; method = ncurses

# visual styles, may be 'stereo' or 'mono'. 
# Stereo mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# Mono averages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies
; style = stereo 


[color]

# supported colors are: red, green, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, blue, black.
; background = black
foreground = magenta


[smoothing]

# multiplier for the integral smoothing calculations. Takes values from 0 - 0.99.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
; integral = 0.7 

# disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing". Default: 1. Set to 0 to disable.
; monstercat = 1 

# Set gravity multiplier for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster. 
# Accepts only non-negative values. 0.5 means half gravity, 2 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
; gravity = 1  


# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this will not be drawn.
; ignore = 0 


[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want. 
# remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
; 1 = 1 # bass
; 2 = 1
; 3 = 1 # midtone
; 4 = 1
; 5 = 1 # treble
