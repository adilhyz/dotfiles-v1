# Explanation: Why are some applications started here and others in bspwmrc?

# There are two types of applications/daemons in my dots.
#	1. Applications that only need to be started once:
#		- Examples: sxhkd, picom, clipboard, xsettings, polkit daemons
#		- These are configured in the bspwmrc file
#		- Don't require restart when changing themes
#	2. Applications that need to restart with each theme change:
#		- Examples: polybar, dunst (notifications)
#		- These are configured in this file
#		- Require restart to apply new theme configuration

# The reason for this separation is that bspwm no longer reloads when changing themes, which means bspwmrc
# doesn't execute on each change. This provides two advantages:
#	- Better fluidity when switching between themes
#	- Lower system load by only restarting necessary functions/processes
